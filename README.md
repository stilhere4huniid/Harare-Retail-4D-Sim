# 🏗️ Harare Retail War Room: 4D Market Simulator

**An Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) tool forecasting the competitive impact of the Mall of Zimbabwe on the Northern Harare retail landscape.**

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project simulates the retail behavior of **1,000+ AI agents** representing shoppers in Harare. It uses a **Gravity Model** combined with **Behavioral Economics** to predict market share shifts across a 4-year timeline (2026 Construction to 2029 Stabilization).

It was designed to answer strategic questions for **WestProp**:
* *"How much market share will we steal from Sam Levy's Village upon launch?"*
* *"Does a 'Luxury' strategy generate more revenue than a 'Mass Market' strategy?"*
* *"How does traffic congestion on Alpes Road affect our catchment area?"*

# ⚠️ Disclaimer

**Educational and Strategic Use Only**

This software is an Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) tool designed for strategic forecasting and scenario planning. 

1.  **Not Financial Advice:** The revenue projections generated by this tool (e.g., "$45.4k") are based on hypothetical "basket size" proxies and do not represent audited financial data or guaranteed returns.
2.  **Data Sources:** While the model uses logic derived from retail economics (Huff Gravity Model), the input data (shopper locations, specific spending power) is simulated and should be calibrated with proprietary data for enterprise use.
3.  **No Liability:** The author (Adonis Chiruka) accepts no liability for investment decisions made based on these simulations.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. The "Eat, Shop, Work, Play" Strategy Engine
Dynamic tenant mix selection that alters the mall's appeal to different demographic segments:
* **🛍️ Luxury Fashion:** Attracts High-Income ($135/visit) shoppers.
* **🎢 Family Entertainment:** Attracts Mass Market ($50/visit) families.
* **💼 Co-working:** Captures the weekday professional crowd.

### 2. 4D Timeline Simulation
A "Time Travel" feature allowing stakeholders to visualize the project lifecycle:
* **2026-27:** Construction Phase (0% Share).
* **2028:** Grand Opening (Launch Hype Bonus).
* **2029:** Market Stabilization.

### 3. Financial & Geospatial Forecasting
* **Revenue Estimator:** Calibrated using 2025 market data (Simbisa/Tourism reports) to estimate turnover based on shopper quality, not just quantity.
* **Live Catchment Map:** Interactive geospatial visualization of shopper migration patterns.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
* **Python** (Core Logic)
* **Mesa** (Agent-Based Modeling)
* **Streamlit** (Interactive Dashboard)
* **Folium** (Geospatial Mapping)
* **FPDF** (Automated Report Generation)

---

## 📉 Methodology
The simulation uses a modified **Huff Gravity Model**:
$$P_{ij} = \frac{U_{ij}}{\sum U_{ik}}$$
Where Utility ($U$) is a function of **Attractiveness** (Tenant Mix) divided by **Distance Friction** (Traffic).
